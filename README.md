## Overview
This project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds and already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).
The main purpose of this project is to learn about testing with Javascript. Testing is an important part of the development 
process and many organizations practice a standard known as "test-driven development" or TDD. This is when developers write 
tests first, before they ever start developing their application.
